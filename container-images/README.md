# Container Images
These are the prebuilt container images that we use in the main project. No modifications should be needed to these images, and the container images are prebuilt and staged on https://hub.docker.com/u/expresshosting automatically.

## Why Prebuilt Images?
This is a matter of personal preference. Having the images built a head of time saves time when you have to rebuild the environment, which I like to do pretty often.
